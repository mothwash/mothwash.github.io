        <h1> what actually matters? </h1>
        <h1> and how do we get it to matter to everyone? </h1>
        <br></br>
        <h3> it's time to get on the same page </h3>
        <h3> i've noticed patterns where some have the right set of values and others do not </h3>
        <br></br>
        <h2> i do not blame people, i blame systems </h2>
        <br></br>
        <h3> so i'm going to define what matters, by writing memoirs and setting objectives </h3>
        <br></br>
        <h1> where do you come in? </h1>
        <p> if your values are in the right place, you only need to look at the objectives and figure out where you can make improvement for all of us </p>
        <p> if you aren't sure your values are aligned, follow the memoirs. read the stories. challenge me and others on these things. ask everyone what they think. let's take these ideas to the arena and sort them out for good. </p>
        <br></br>
        <h1> objectives and their targets (for now) </h1>
        <br></br>

        <h2> state responsibility and basic needs </h2>
        <h4> everyone is entitled to and must have access to water, food, shelter, healthcare, electricity, and education - this would best be provided by the state </h4>
        <br></br>

        <h2> wealth/resource distribution </h2>
        <h4> every employer must offer a livable wage </h4>
        <h4> organizations will be regulated to avoid abuse or hording of resources </h4>
        <br></br>

        <h2> equality </h2>
        <h4> no harm must come unto others, and all beliefs/actions/practices will be tolerated and accepted so long as they do not deprive others of their rights/liberties and consent is provided by all under full understanding. </h4>
        <h4> if the risk of accepting a belief/action/practice increases a threat to a basic need, it must be regulated until that risk is mitigated.
        <h4> justice will be remedial and will seek to give more rights and liberties through restoration of a moral contract and non-violent/non-manipulative corrective action. </h4>
        <br></br>

        <h2> community </h2>
        <h4> you owe participation in the systems around you that contribute to any of these targets </h4>

        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h1> examples </h1>
        <br></br>
        <h2> guns in homes </h2>
        <h4> some have a cultural attachment to guns, but having guns in the home increases the threat to children's survival. </h4>
        <h4> therefore, guns must be regulated until that threat is no longer statistically present. </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h2> healthcare </h2>
        <h4> eventually, this would best be covered by the state completely, and resources would need to be provided to secure ubiquitous access. </h4>
        <h4> for now, any progress towards increasing access or greater involvement of the state (without decreasing access/quality), is an improvement. </h4>
        <h4> increases to quality cannot come at a compromise to access, since this detracts progress from meeting basic needs. </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h2> economic competition </h2>
        <h4> a small business cannot afford to support its employees at a livable wage. </h4>
        <h4> this is not a successful business and either the industry will be regulated or the small business must lose to other business that can provide safety and security to their workers. </h4>
        <h4> if the latter option is elected, there must be regulation to avoid the abuse or hording of resources. </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h2> self-elected sterilization </h2>
        <h4> let's suppose elected sterilzations become a popular practice, so much that it makes harvesting needed resources more difficult with fewer people. </h4>
        <h4> the solution is to find better ways to use the resources, not to interrupt the practice. so long as the practice is consentual with all parties, it must be protected. </h4>
        <h4> if providers were to say they no longer wanted to offer their services, they are now hording resources, and justice will be administered at the development of technology, teaching, or other means to either increase access to the procedure or better utilize resources. this prevents dirupting the wishes of those electing for the procedure and those that don't want to provide their services. </h4>

        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <h3> anything you can do towards these goals is an improvement and worthwhile endeavor </h3>
        <h3> this is a simple framework. it is designed to better ourselves and our neighbors </h3>
        <h3> some situations are more difficult to correct. working together will help. ask for help from others </h3>
        <h3> please continue. please take care of yourself. fight the good fight. <h3> -->
