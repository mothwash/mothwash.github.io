              <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> a liar telling the truth by accident - schema-abreact </h1>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">fossilized verisimilitude drinks like black gold. children of bias and paramnesia, oily factoids are refined and run through digital panoptic pumps. from precision to recall, sensitivity to specificity, the desire machine is a confusion matrix, where the essence of lack is steeped in falsehoods. in order to execute integrity in the post truth society, there needs to be a reconstruction of identity. start with the redirection of adversity, adrenergic and primordial. then come the abbreviated semiotic chains, linguistic aerialism and label generation. possession follows, prescribing selfhood in grievous contrast to the assumptions of reality. then come the superposition optics, the reconciliation of proportionality and experience. by integrating the subjectification of truth with tyrannical institutions, enervated research, and imbued ritualism; the post-truth structuralist will desire all that counters modus operandi.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">there is an operant model for the illusory mind folding that transpires over distrust. there is an anchor for relevance and that is asperity. the prodding of the physical world reinforces not only our mortal fate, it also corrals our intention. in post truth structuralism specifically, it is important to convince the reader that both they, character-leaders, and the author traverse portals where they readily accept the modal reactions against the newly perceived pain. particularly the modality of critical obligation. any provided information is filtered through this lens of relevance, specific and sensitive to the conditions the character-leaders endure.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">as in Orwellian dystopians and Derrida’s discourse, aporia stretches the word. freshly tinkered tools make for incombatative subordinates, completely dislocated from anteriorially confirmed common tongue. the machine is all trustful, whereas the counter-machine is inherently disobedient. distrust paradoxically stems from compliance. this becomes evident in the case of the search engine. the results, summoned in microseconds, come trained from the obfuscated actions of counter-machines. in the ultimate relevance, pain is avoided or intentionally opposed, an intention mirrored in the search engine’s attempts to seduce the searcher. errors ensue when the machine inaccurately or ineffectively draws results nocuous to the reader’s contradictions. reproducing these errors in droves, however, does not illicit distrust. it’s the forgery of this classification system that causes distraction.</p>
              <br></br>
            </div>

            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">this model then perpetrates the individual, authoritatively demanding the release of any alternate loyalties. in absolutism, there is vigilant innocence, everything excuses. generally, thought patterns are products of large pockets. commandeered thought is achieved by spectacle, catastrophizing, and other cognitive distortions in tangent with institutional degradation. the methods of comparison and confirmation are complicated by resistance to opposition. nothing may be asked of future commutuality.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">in disorder to understand, let us calculate. value is in the search for truth. for example, a beggar is attuned to true and false positives and negatives. the benevolence of a transient bears certain truths and falsehoods. the experience of this recipient sampled is purely positive and cumulative. precision in this case lies in actions, the true grace over the complete positive yield, positive as in experienced; it is  signaled to the beggar that there is a fragmented proportion of mercy. countered to this precision is the fraction of recall, ciphered by counting the true positives over the sum of true kindness, which cannot be counted without knowing the value of false negatives or the passerbys that never cross paths. notice now, where are the true negatives? they represent those that never cross paths, however, these are biased predictions. even in the 'weighted harmonic mean of both precision and recall,' the beggar institutes some biases to assume that those not meeting chance would find the beggar unworthy. this is obviously distressful. if one is conciliated to the true value of negatives, then an informedness may be deducted by summing recall, or sensitivity, with its inverse specificity, otherwise known as the now known true negatives over that value and the experienced false positives. this would be the feeling of proportional paltriness compared to all the spit and bile in the beggar’s face. finally, markedness or the phi coefficient is the closest value to assimilate the confusion matrix. is a specified distribution present in outcome frequencies in a sample? do we now know the 'goodness' of fit?</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the despot would feed you with certaint sensitive information, knowingly false bits and bites fractioned by illusive true negatives. you can know intuitively what you have never seen, all limned in the desire object, an ambiguous and anachronistic reflection of designed lack.</p>
              <br></br>
            </div>

            <div class="carousel-item">
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">[1. In a world where integrity seems to be gone, there are 4 steps to take in order to counter the lies built in one's culture. a) identify one's pain and the directions it sends oneself b) notice one's labels around pain and desire c) take note of how one takes possession of certain labels and d) see if one's possessions are proportional and considerable to the experience of others. </p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">2. Pain is our anchor and attention grabber. "Shoulds" or critical obligations, only matter to oneself if relevant to their experience.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">3. Labels allow for irresolvable contradictions to exist in one’s logic. Like looking for something in a search engine, one only knows what’s yielded. The search engine won’t give one the perfect information nor will it give one all the information. It classifies one’s search and pieces together what it’s been trained to reveal. This information could contradict itself, but one knows what one is looking for. One will do the work to couple or decouple this information based on the expectation of the search and the results.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">4.Complete possession of these results creates a kind of loyalty that is instantly excused from any criticism. Large funding of broad-reaching misinformation campaigns can design a propaganda machine that uses cognitive distortions to compare and affirm the misinformation.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">5.A confusion matrix includes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. One cannot calculate them all without bias. The unhoused ask for money, and in this example, the true positives and negatives are whether or not someone gives money when they pass the human asking. False positives and negatives can’t be known, only assumed, since we do not know of how someone will react if they haven’t encountered this person. What becomes normalized in this person’s thinking is generally an assumption that if someone doesn’t pass them, they wouldn’t give anyway, as if they’re avoiding this person (whether from lack of funds or wanting to escape the unhoused). </p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">6. The phi coefficient is the relationship between a table of data that shows for accuracy in a confusion matrix. Essentially, if all one finds to be true relies on assumptions of what hasn’t been experienced, then one’s predictive skills are poor and will yield more bias.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">7. If the news seems false and one is basing this prediction on what hasn’t been experienced, then the predictive accuracy gets weaker. An authoritarian will make one practice this until one has redefined pain, adopted new labels, taken possession of certain labels, and compared their experience as true to the assumed falsification of others experiences. Lack is only an enemy when designed that way. The opportunity to be curious and add more to your true yield, no matter how painful, is worth the work.]</p>

              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the characters are going to be a part of a collection written by the liar that tells the truth. the liar is telling the truth by accident, as the collection is full of improbable accidents written by an author familiar with failing and casualties. each character is a casualty of truth, living in a matrix of perspective and circumstance; all perpendicular tries are casual as parallel. the girl who speaks in overlap is nodding, but also shaking her head. she is painting a broken bottle over a filling glass over a shaking hand over a steady stream. she is asking the reader to not pick one of all time and to pick one of no moment. </p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">art is the finality of impossible specificity and stalwart sensitivity. the step in moment where a liar's words are boots beneath the water line. the reader is probably riverside, splitting glass to curb the blood mania. this is woeLove, where the reader feels empty, static, useless, out of touch, crushed, like an argument that just ended, buried, muddled, collapsed, cosmically abandoned, missing from the ephemeraforming. blood looks like oil in red light, or in other words, keep digging. </p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the author is an artist that fails to finish, so the characters will be perma-steeped in a perjuror’s truth and schema-abreact to a wall posting in a dingy shoegaze dive. for the answers retained, they are here to populate.</p>

              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the preacher of recall has found a redundancy in this collection and the author is confirming; the reader will have to trust their scioptics. consta-gnosis is how we confirm the human consciousness, and also how we ignore it. knowledge is a derivative of pain, so the preacher of recall has asked the author to provide it. the artist who fails to finish anything believes this is techne-pain, or specified agony, something beholden to the resistance of religion. the preacher will bypass specificty, channeling an amalgam of nervous breakdowns, cosmic miscommunication, and relatable rhetoric. nevertheless, spirituality is welcome in post truth structuralist desires. the difference is in the invitation. so for this collection, we give the reader ‘lack’, in hopes that they will find themselves welcomed uninvited. it is specific in that it refuses to exist. </p>
              <br></br>
              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">in such case, the reader will have to negotiate with the liar writing this collection for the truth, and pray a car comes colliding into them.</p>

              <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">in a normal distribution, there exists a stronghold on the majority and a weakness in deviation. clearly this collection is written by deviants. in the binary confusion matrix between deviants and the majority, there must be fortification for truth to meet a measure of effectiveness in diagnostic odds. it’s up to the reprobate, deep pockets, to weigh heavily on the false omission and false discovery rates against predisposed and conditioned populants. the bed-making doxa listens attentively to deep pockets, and they rhetorize around campfires with cheap flashlights unfolding their features. the bed-making doxa has only heard the negative and rejects it as anything other than positive, a foreboding of asperity. the girl who speaks in overlaps has noticed no sweat in bed-making doxa’s berth, and offers a counter-terror in attempt to change that.</p>
