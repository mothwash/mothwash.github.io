            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology II. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">Ekwus began as one ambiguous stochastic being divided in two at the tongue, into Anger, into Patience. Anger was quick to sense, flippant and deranged, the bitter relishment of being. in the presence of Patience, however, Anger disappeared into her totalove. dissolved by her taste, Anger designed the natural mechanics of organic cells under the soothing pressure of wait. wanting this perfect feeding cycle to proliferate, Anger fired a cosmic hurricane with its trail which materialized into Discovery and Loss, spawning the origins of fatherhood and the question of absence. wonder (infantinomi for discovery), being so sensitive, looked weak to Anger. when Discovery was beat, they divided into three gods; the chromosomal being Creation and Destruction, the third some combination of gravitational math / the returning of soul to the body ten times (they call them Mnemosyne).</p><br></br>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology III. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">Randomness slowly ceased with the swelling of conscience in the universe, a surge that will erupt repeatedly in what is known as the anecdote or myth. the thoughts of others drove Creation to hum a melody from which the sentient horse was designed with artistic inclinations for sewing. this was the first species and they roamed stars freely. equines used their own integumentary for their work, which Creation culturally appropriated. she began to dress in doppler-trimmed horse-hair bricolage. her closet incited Love from fellow gods and invited revolutionary class-related warring from the equine. Destruction attempted to impress Creation by building a machine for ripping the mane off a horse’s neck in a single switch. Dazzled, Creation hungered for egregiously abundant bundles of mane, which Destruction found encouraging. unfortunately, a salacious side in gods demoralized and dismantled the sensibilities of the equine kingdom. at the battle scene finale, Creation strung a bow from the king’s mane and played Anna Clyne’s prince of clouds on a double necked violin. gravitational math / returning of soul to body ten times watched from the back of a black sheep and asked his eldest sister, Loss, to surgically extract the piercing in his heart and stitch it into spacetime. Here, a heavy memory of Discovery spins into blackness. Loss and gravitational math / returning of soul to body ten times begot Death, aesthetically akin to an author-sculpted stone never sculpted to appear as anything other than a stone. the line of mortality continues, gaseous and solid, as planets.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br></br>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology IV. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">Destruction continued to sluice colliding atoms from Anger, and explored supernova energy scientifically. Anger tracked his cabinet full of bottles, discolored with smashed atoms, draining slowly. Instead of seeking immediate retribution for Destruction’s thievery, Anger enlisted entropy for the universe to prolong the course of destruction. while this was happening, Time stretched out on the sofa for Creation, both nude and easel settled. Patience, the mother of this rebellious pair, responded to her daughters sensuality by having an affair with Curiosity. after their entanglement, Patience grew weighted with Accident, an encumbrance, yet also an embrace of evergreen learning. Anger fumed into the guilt of Regrettable Mistakes, bringing no-fucks-given into anthroposture. rumors suggest Negligence may have been the third part in an ignominious threesome. practically orphaned, no-fucks-given spent xyr formative years chasing Destruction until their unionization. they met at an asteroid fringe knocking orbital weapons into small stars. they were an explosive cluster, but no-fucks-given only drove Destruction to Creation. to break the penchant of xe’s co-dependence, Destruction warped no-fucks-given into the past. through remorseful incest, Creation tempered Destruction with the spawning of Control. Destruction was penalized by Anger’s sight of his offspring, and worse yet tormented by Creation’s decisions as to who the godmother of Control would be. no-fucks-given had found and befriended Creation through casual inebriated brunches while Destruction razed the universe with his mistress. Control was raised with her godmother’s intuition and uncovered a perpetual balance between risk and expectation, both of which were love crafted to be childhood friends. The genderless child of Time, Addiction, grew up alone until xe met Control. When Loss visited with her children, Control was sundered by withdrawing afflictions. she seized at the family bbq, and Time ripped off a finger worth a trillion years called Healing. the touch of healing sent Control into a torpid slumber, the first comatose. Healing studied interstellar anatomy during this time while no-fucks-given smoked cheap tobacco with Addiction.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br></br>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology V. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">Curiosity whispered into Accident‘s ear that an uprising was imminent while Negligence walked about absent mindedly. the Oracle of Gambled Anticipation also gabbed to Healing about an upcoming war. when brought to the supreme gods, the original division of Ewkus, Healing won an accordance with the council for granted medical service immune to violence. Anger cursed Negligence then sailed for war. Destruction, enlisted as head commander, decimated orbital geode and starlight source indiscriminately. their combined power would surely supercede that of the equines. tucked in the darkness of space, the equine people watched in worship, pulling Anger’s power into their flanks. the ambush of eighty billion equine erupted spacetime which launched the rebels into hyperspeed (time arched into an incapacitated state) and their collusion was meteoric. the gods fled to the surface of an atmosphere rich asteroid in panic. old age struck them heavily and a pantheon was constructed to discuss retirement packages. they first invited the equine people to rest with them at the cost of their language, conscience, and intellect. They would agree on the following conditions; they kept their memories of their comrades, that their bodies on the circling children known as Death would bloom into gardens, and that they would remain innocent creatures in their ignorance. the ennui of Creation called for the development of an intriguing servant species to ride the equine, but also be spoiled and starved throughout the gods retirement. As the final sacrifice in the equine uprising resolution, gravitational math / returning of soul to the body ten times plummeted into Deaths core and allowed the servants, or people, to rest by the weight of their being.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs</p><br></br>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology VI. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">new gods blossomed into a movement. divisions and procreations torrented through the higher power, giving depth and layers to the people below. they tended to a fresh god, the youngest celestial known as Soul Food in a Communal Garden. they worked with allegiance to the primordial stars, Anger and Patience, but the gods’ celebratory copulation made room for distraction from the meekness of early people. The curse of Negligence unfolded after his discovery of the couples reunion. Negligence and his tears dehydrated him out of existence and flooded the garden below. Regrettable Mistake, partner of Anger and Negligence, had been pregnant to term when she heard of lost Negligence. Her daughter was born as Suicide, the namesake and post-parted depression of her mother. the flood spared no fauna and from the psyche of people, Soul Food in a Communal Garden divided into 3 gods (ego, id, superego). The Cemetery is a single stone that was revealed in one section’s mudslide. all the dead plants and sleeping people were piled together beneath this stone and a garden was repaved over the soil by all living hands. Treeforts began as a colossal oak that folded it’s limbs to protect a nymph of which it was found. the nymph invited up the people that remained and the few that accepted received individual tree forts. their descendants would always seek shelter in solitudinous nature. a smaller number of the id-bark people found one or two others to let in to the treeforts, but only after a mystery laden emotional hunt was completed for each other’s understanding. the final garden god was Organization, a regenerative people tilling the land and communicating effectively. these people and their progeny will reap the rewards of sustained real estate. they live in the mud where they conduct deals and superegos and such.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br></br>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> ekwus cosmology VII. </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">as the people grew, Expectation felt both hopeful and jealous of their fortune. with Habit, they birthed Romant. Romant fell in love instantly and vowed never to love another. his love died almost immediately in tragic accident and Romant created the Afterlife to chase her; he also created Heartbreakingfailure to feel driven. the souls from the Cemetery all followed Romant between the sacrificed heart of Gravitational Math and the initiation of NewBabylon, or the surface world wherever a chair is sitting next to a bookshelf. in this new realm, Afterlife worked eighty hours a week with little managerial experience. requesting assistance, Organization was brought in as a consultant to advise on the situation. the underrealm endured chaos from overcrowding. this underground nightmare jaw needed to be divided into separate space for kindness and malevolence. one would be called Intergenerational Neighborly Kindness, and the other Moth Faucet, each with gods to reign. seemed simple, one group bakes pies for the house next door and the other sucks their mouth around a pump of furry insects. the horror and beauty of each inspired people to believe that the gods of the afterlife were adjudicators for placement. the truth is that assignments are random.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs</p><br></br>

Of this feral mating spree came two other gods, Laughter and Forgiveness, each of which born into fatherless homes. Anger adopted them both for their resilience. at first they were the gentlest of children. yet after time, Laughter adapted the cruelty of Anger, whereas Forgiveness was frequently sneaking out after curfew. with ingenuity, Forgiveness crafted a conveyor belt of Anger’s cognac bottles camouflaged with rose bushes. when Forgiveness was out on a walk, she found Heartbreakingfaulure and was struck with infatuation then sprinted back for a plucked rose. their allure strengthened over frequent encounters. after weeks, the thinning of the rose bushes exposed the escape track. when Forgiveness made the decision to attack the persona, apply pressure, and open an innerconversation; Forgiveness summoned more power than Anger and hammered him into the earth. the child of Forgiveness and Heartbreakingfailure was Eternal Growth, the last god to be born.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br></br>

Destruction targeted their resources. the adaptive and agile Capital Gain burgled new industries of their character or culture. only their bureaucracy was weakness. knowing this, Destruction enlisted Risk to forward repeatedly conflicting memos that bottlenecked the operation. after the sabotage, Capital Gain remains watched by people from menial means, the blue collar Geiger counter for unfettered greed. the last purchaser of a factory hat was Heartbreakingfaiure, now referred to as A Soaking Hat on a Head that Never Turns, wanders aimlessly, dangerously close to the countdown. people sometimes catch this hat brushing past commoners at a frigid humid dusk.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">remember, the children live upstairs</p><br></br>
