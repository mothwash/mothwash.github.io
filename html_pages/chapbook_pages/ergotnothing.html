Jess closed in for the kill with her story about lighting Kim Gordon’s cigarette with Kim’s lighter she stole earlier. my daughter has that lighter now and carries it like a rabbit’s foot. don’t be afraid to say it. don’t be afraid. we should do this again sometime.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">VIII</p><br></br>
