[whisper here in the bed frame brackets] here’s a cat that understands the news. reach for the extension cable, we are outlets of electric shells. a coin toss for the water cup, high demand in the ash palace. wet synth in the floorboards, they creak slowly under our naked heels. softened in the dawn time. waking highness shakes a lion’s mane. she is the crocus yard and i am the door that leads to her. she is brought inside, she is light and nitrogen through the window. everything is sticky soil, we are grounded seeds incubating.</p><br></br>
