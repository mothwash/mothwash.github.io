I’ll buy you some tissue shaped flowers from the gift shop after, i promise.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">what do you call an ice cube between freezing and melting? this question knocks me unconscious if the ice cube is half way up or down the glass.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">we had a lovely time spying on the reactions of potential candidates as they sat on the lobby couch possessed by a demon that’s possessed by a cat. hell would speak their nightmares to life in latin-leaning english and then the security guard would resolve the screams of the dead by bringing over a vacuum that would cause the couch to hiss then return to normal.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">after the story, you ran your finger up and down the CIA promotional (over)throw pillow and we got in the mood. there’s a connection between us that rivals not only the probability of shuffling a deck of cards identically, but having a deck shuffled the same by a cat knocking the cards to the floor when we weren’t paying attention.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">let’s go tie one on now at the bar that sells alien liquor and time traveling diaries. we’ll make our own chronology by writing dates down on bar napkins from stories we liked in the order we preferred. right before we leave, i squeeze all the tapas together in one hand and take a bite. the cab driver is looking at me crazy as i flag it down with a bunch of napkins on my hand. As my hands dry, they fly out the cab window and make little sculptures on the city street. we forget to tell the driver to switch back to the hour hand and end up taking an hour long loop. there are several pop up picture book pages dedicated to this scene.</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">it’s almost time to make another novelty snow globe.</p><br></br></div>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> yeast rises best under foil // conflict for consciousness </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">egregious little clock slips. i swear it was just 6 years ago. there’s a failure of both fire and plattered appreciation too. i take this temporality and preheat it to 450. the oven warms by crossing borders with rosy cheeks in split seconds. my head skips at its heaviest, the center of dancing melodic intervals. it gets fuzzier. loops and tickles itself in the feedback. sips on dreams through gauze. there’s so much to say that the roof of my mouth is sweating and i would very much like to spit. the trail of tears is minutes and centuries and presently away from here. space and time are ovens we bake our heads in and the dial configurations are unique to all of us.</p><br></br></div>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> shower thoughts take up too much room </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">i shower with some company policies and some loose expressions from my childhood and a meritocracy throwing up on the bath pillow and i reluctantly let them under the water. the loofah is a net of succoring axiology, or vampire’s garlic in this case. the visual depiction of tension, an imagined knot of hair caught on the curtain, untangles in the epistemology of steam and god’s snakes. there is a trickly of shampoo painting the porcelain and i keep stopping the loose expressions from licking the trail. they are lost with knew knowledge yet enamored with straight lines. the meritocracy tries to court the snakes, but apples fall furthest along slippery slopes. trust me, i had to put the soap there. it’s for the best.</p><br></br></div>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> to taste loss in each barrel </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">no shotgun scares me. i have felt the heaviness of viscera in strands guarding the emptiness forced upon me. defeat has found fertility in my chest and plants here frequently. far more foreign are the beliefs in luck or talent. if there are cosmic and eugenic gifts, know that i openly scorn them. it’s my curiosity that nurtures the fruit of loss. i eat it like i have to and taste a ferrous bitterness around a hollow core. so what do i do? put up some tape and plastic wrap? insert little whispers to clean up the ravagings? make little trinkets out of tissue and puppeteer them for others? all this healing just for defeat to see me again and dig a double barrel in my ribcage.</p><br></br></div>

            <div class="carousel-item"><h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center"> a springhare's burrow of gifts </h1><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">only one springhare, the one tendered by Doase, could store memories in items. Doase tidied the burrow one morning and picked up a hair tie through which they witnessed themself say, “with one eye we’re curious and the second, over-confident, miss mouse.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">through the strip of ripped upholstery, Doase said, “both rest and unrest stir us, but i’ll be damned if i go stirless.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">on touching the bookmark, “some of the truest stories have never been, yet always will be for how they were told.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the marble, “meritocracy and trade are machinations of the greedy. for every gift i give you, please know it is not about fairness, but the simple love of passing something special from one to another.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the train ticket, “while much is unknown, fear cannot take what we know to be true.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">a list of tasks, “procrastination is only the thief of time if you don’t give some of your time as an offering.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the fringe of a nightcap, “miss mouse, you’ve hardly touched your dinner! how will you possibly keep your heart burning?”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">a foreign coin, “loyalty is just an acceptance of someone’s mistakes, as long as they try to fix their mistakes. i will not define love for you in the same breath because they are galaxies apart.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">blue sewing string, “power is in the possible. like how we can still see through all the tears. even in grief, we have the power to feel close to those we love.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">the shredded stuffing of a plush potato, “you chew through toys like consumption chews through our experiences, miss mouse.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">excess patches used as critter quilts, “that’s a lot of heat for such a little form, you must have all the conviction we’ve been missing.”</p><br></br><p class="d-flex justify-content-center">and deepest in the burrow, a shriveled cap to a chestnut, “can we be friends, miss mouse? i promise to give so much love to you, even if love is being sapped from the world at an alarming rate. your story and mine will become one and the same. and far in the future, with the tears through which i say goodbye, our love will have taught us everything we need to see beyond and everything we need to go forward.”</p><br></br></div>
