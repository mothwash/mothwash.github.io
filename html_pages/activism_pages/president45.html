In fact, I’ll go a step further: The people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don’t know who he is. It’s crazy.” This is false. Numerous accounts from Obama’s college classmates refute Trump’s claim, including Obama’s Columbia roommate, Phil Doerner.</p><a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/recollections-of-obamas-ex-roommate/">1</a></ul></li>

In 2011, Trump told Bill O’Reilly, “If you are going to be president of the United States you have to be born in this country. And there is a doubt as to whether or not he was… He doesn’t have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there’s something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. I don’t know. Maybe he doesn’t want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn’t born in this country, it’s one of the great scams of all time.” In response to the “birther” conspiracy theory, the State of Hawaii released Barack Obama’s short- and long-form birth certificate.</p><a href=" http://nation.foxnews.com/donald-trump/2011/03/30/trump-obama-maybe-hes-muslim">1</a><a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/obama-birth-certificate-document-/1#.WrQ8OpPwbOQ">2</a><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate.pdf">3</a></ul></li>

Trump said in a speech at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, "He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” Trump’s comments drew boos from his audience in Iowa, as well as widespread condemnation from Republicans and Democrats alike. Donald Trump himself was exempted from military service after receiving four student deferments between 1964 and 1968, and a medical deferment for a “bone spur in his foot” after graduating from college.</p><a href="... https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-12031">1</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html%E2%80%9D">2</a></ul></li>

You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?” The next day, Trump told a CNN interviewer that Kelly had been “off-base” in the way she treated him. “She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions,” Trump said. “You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”</p><a href="... http://time.com/3988288/republican-debate-megyn-kelly/">1</a><a href="http://time.com/3989652/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-blood-wherever/">2</a></ul></li>

While China’s theft of American intellectual property has long struck economists as a serious problem in the economic relationship between the two world powers, many economists viewed Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods as a poor strategy for addressing the issue. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, said “Any good strategy has to include getting other countries on your side. If it’s the United States versus China, we’re similar sized economies. If it’s the United States and the world versus China, that’s not something China can win.”</p><a href="... https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-will-hit-china-with-trade-measures-as-white-house-exempts-allies-from-tariffs.html">1</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/business/economy/trump-economists.html">2</a></ul></li>

McMaster’s replacement, John Bolton, was in Trump’s original consideration for the position, but lost the spot because the president didn’t like his mustache. The new hire would likely affect U.S. strategy for the upcoming diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea, as Bolton has long expressed hawkish views on North Korea.
