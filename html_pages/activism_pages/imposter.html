          <br></br><h3> Mental Health for BIPOC Summary </h3>
          <h4> In addition to COVID-19, recent events have brought heightened attention to the specific stressors faced by Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, who may be experiencing heightened fear, anger and grief at this time. Consistent with the Guide’s mission to provide timely mental health resources, we highlight a range of resources that may be useful to <em>BIPOC-identifying individuals seeking support for mental health concerns and/or coping with race-related stressors,</em> whether current and/or historical, as well as those hoping to share available resources to their patients. Mass General Psychiatry is not affiliated with, nor does it directly endorse, any non-MGH organizations listed here. This list is intended only to share resources currently available in the broader community. </h4>
