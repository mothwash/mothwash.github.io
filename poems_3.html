Anger was quick to sense, flippant and deranged, the bitter relishing of being. in the presence of Patience, however, Anger disappeared into totalove. dissolved by her taste, Anger designed hydroponics and the natural mechanics of organic cells under the soothing pressure of Wait. wanting this perfect feeding cycle to proliferate, Anger fired a cosmic hurricane that materialized into Discovery, with its trail, Loss. Anger spawned the origins of fartherhood and the question of absence. Discovery, being so sensitive, looked weak to Anger. when Discovery was beat, they divided into three gods; the chomosomal being Creation (she is wonder) and Desruction (he is resolution), the third some combination of gravitational math / the returning of the soul to the body ten times (they call them Mnemosyne)</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br>

Destruction attempted to impress Creation by building a machine for ripping the mane off a horse’s neck in a single switch. Dazzled, Creation hungered for egregiously abundant bundles of mane, which Destruction found encouraging. unfortunately, a salacious side in gods demoralized and dismantled the sensibilities of the equine kingdom. against power, they paled and felt thin in their coats. at the battle scene finale, Creation strung a bow from the king’s mane and played Anna Clyne’s prince of clouds on a double necked violin. gravitational math / returning of soul to body ten times watched from the back of a black sheep and asked his eldest sister, Loss, to surgically extract the piercing in his heart and stitch it into spacetime. Here, a heavy memory of Discovery spins into blackness. Loss and gravitational math / returning of soul to body ten times begot Death, aesthetically akin to an author-sculpted stone never sculpted to appear as anything other than a stone. the line of mortality continues, gaseous and solid, as planets.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br>

Anger tracked his cabinet full of bottles, discolored with smashed atoms, draining slowly. Instead of seeking immediate retribution for Destruction’s thievery, Anger enlisted entropy for the universe to prolong the course of destruction. the chaos would soon render Destruction’s path pointless. while this was happening, Time stretched out on the sofa for Creation, both nude and easel settled. Patience, the mother of this rebellious pair, responded to her daughters sensuality by having an affair with Curiosity, a god made of children’s puzzle toys and a mind’s eye. after their entanglement, Patience grew weighted with Accident, an encumbrance, yet also an embrace of evergreen learning. again, Envy committed another comedy of errors with the most furious god. Anger fumed into the guilt of Regrettable Mistakes, bringing no-fucks-given into the universe. rumors suggest Negligence may have been the third part in an ignominious threesome. practically orphaned, no-fucks-given spent their formative years chasing Destruction until their unionization. they met at an asteroid fringe knocking orbital weapons into small stars. they were an explosive cluster, but no-fucks-given only drove Destruction to Creation. to break the penchant of theirco-dependence, Destruction warped no-fucks-given into the past. Creation tempered Destruction through remorseful incest and spawned Control. Destruction was penalized when Anger bore witness to his offspring, and was worse yet tormented by Creation’s decisions as to who the godmother of Control would be. No-fucks-given, after being fired into the past, had found and befriended Creation through casual inebriated brunches while Destruction razed the universe with his mistress. Control was raised with her godmother’s intuition and uncovered a perpetual balance between Risk and Expectation, both of which were love crafted to be childhood friends. the genderless child of Time, Addiction, grew up alone until they met Control. they were inseparatable and Control became disoriented. when Loss visited with her children, Control was sundered by withdrawing afflictions. she seized at the family bbq, and Time ripped off a finger worth a trillion years called Healing. the touch of healing sent Control into a torpid slumber, the first comatose. Healing studied interstellar anatomy during this time while no-fucks-given smoked cheap tobacco with Addiction.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br>

Anger cursed Negligence then sailed for war. Destruction, enlisted as head commander, decimated orbital geode and starlight source indiscriminately. their combined power would surely supercede that of the equines. tucked in the darkness of space, the equine people watched in worship, pulling Anger’s power into their flanks. the ambush of eighty billion equine erupted spacetime which launched the rebels into hyperspeed (time arched into an incapacitated state) and their collusion was meteoric. the gods fled to the surface of an atmosphere rich asteroid in panic. old age struck them heavily and a pantheon was constructed to discuss retirement packages. they first invited the equine people to rest with them at the cost of their language, conscience, and intellect. the equine kingdom would agree on the following conditions; they kept their memories of their comrades, that their bodies on the circling children known as Death would bloom into gardens, and that they would remain innocent creatures in their ignorance. it was a boring resolution. the ennui of Creation called for the development of an intriguing servant species to ride the equine, but also be spoiled and starved throughout the gods retirement. as the final sacrifice in the equine uprising resolution, gravitational math / returning of soul to the body ten times plummeted into Deaths core and allowed the servants, or people, to rest by the weight of their being.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs</p><br>

The curse of Negligence unfolded after he was left without a partner to reture with. Negligence and his tears dehydrated out of conscious existence and flooded the garden below. Regrettable Mistake, ex-partner of Anger and Negligence, had been pregnant to term when she heard of lost Negligence. Her daughter was born as Suicide, the namesake and post-parted depression of her mother. Suicide, immortal as heartbreak, would lean against strangers she met on ledges for comfort. the flood spared no fauna and from the tripartite psyche of people, Soul Food in a Communal Garden divided into 3 gods (reason, spirit, and appetite) to aid in psychological recovery. these garden gods buried themselves in the minds of laymen to bring prosperity and paradise and saccharine soil to feed on the thoughts. the anti-garden god was Organization, patroned by naturally regenerative people tilling the land and communicating mechanically. these people and their progeny will reap the rewards of sustained real estate. they live in the mud where they conduct deals and egos and such.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br>

Of this feral mating spree came two other gods, Laughter and Forgiveness, each of which born into fatherless homes. Anger adopted them both for their resilience. at first they were the gentlest of children. yet after time, Laughter adapted the cruelty of Anger, whereas Forgiveness was frequently sneaking out after curfew. with ingenuity, Forgiveness crafted a conveyor belt of Anger’s cognac bottles camouflaged with rose bushes. when Forgiveness had escaped for a walk, she found Heartbreakingfailure. Forgiveness was struck with infatuation then sprinted back for a plucked rose. their allure strengthened over frequent encounters. after weeks, the thinning of the rose bushes exposed the escape track. while Anger was guzzling colliding atoms from his liquor cabinet, Forgiveness made the decision to attack the persona, apply pressure, and open an innerconversation; Forgiveness summoned more power than Anger and hammered him into the earth. the child of Forgiveness and Heartbreakingfailure was Eternal Growth, the last god to be born.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs.</p><br>

Destruction targeted their resources, taking out the banks with fire. the adaptive and agile Capital Gain burgled new industries of their character or culture. only their bureaucracy was weakness. discovering this, Destruction enlisted Risk to forward repeatedly conflicting memos that bottlenecked the operation. after the sabotage, Capital Gain remains watched by people from menial means, the blue collar Geiger counter for unfettered greed. the last purchaser of a factory hat was Heartbreakingfaiure, now referred to as A Soaking Hat on a Head that Never Turns, wanders aimlessly, dangerously close to the countdown. people sometimes catch this hat brushing past commoners at a frigid humid dusk.</p><br><p>remember, the children live upstairs</p><br>

We will look up from the carpet and lie until our teeth are too obviously whispering to each other. the pieces we promise come up as crumbs. the crumbs we promise already vacuumed by our lips. we suck in everything until we suck in ourselves. sometimes in sobriety, we scream for a prayer and annoy bystanders. every now and then the prayer is dialed and the authorities are summoned. we are only helpful in the way that we help officers earn their keep. it’s weeks of leeching before that. i laugh at the blood spilling from my finger because it looks like turtle calvary. i seal it with a hot spoon, a tiny torched alien saucer. it’s all i’ve laughed at for weeks. the turtles are being experimented on, objective repurposing. my body gets pins and needles too, and i feel a new wave of turtles that want out.</p><br>

                      <p> climbed the whitewash and stomped on it until the tide, death, and bumper stickers jutted from the sand. Co-existence peeked out inimically. the ocean wandered through, parched and ceremonial, riding a camel, both separated from their newborns. the ocean swayed tectonically, and we stood around car bits. put your ear to the muffler, it sounds like me. the continent found paradise in driftwood charred lizard guts, then hallucinated that reality looked like dry bleakness, bleeding from granular scrapes all at the surface. continents are puppies at perma-sit, petulant for attention and puerile with their conversation. the continent often bears lone witness to a howling imagination, ripe with planet collision and the alien abduction of beaches, a certain deskinning if you will. i suggested we pack up, put the crest at the bottom, heaviest first. these desert dunes remind me of subcutaneous insects feeding under atmospheric skin; slightly raised, alive, and immune. a cut down the middle would open the blood creek, drown the sand and skin scorpions until their pincers looked like rotted coral. the ocean looks at me without forgiveness and with scales in her teeth. the continent will meet her gaze, and they will discuss speed bumps in parking garages. they will discuss cumulus chaos, their conspiracies and documentaries. an undertow feels like a long conversation drawn out by unbridled neuron waving. the casualty of listlessness is inside us. the ocean is also inside us, but that wet is making me cold. i am an earthquake, torn between two homes: a shallow shelf and the bottomless well.
  </p><br>
                      <p> cacti gesticulate their hellos in comic ways, a greeting that eases me as we leave the fried car behind. wreathed in a rubber tire, one cactus is staring down desert flames. axles are melting into oh shapes and sea shapes. it is a violation to touch anything in this country except bedrock. desperate ascetics dig with reservoir dreams. they are right to do so with the alien library just miles below. our trio are the surgeons operating while the patients operate with us. a delicate language tucked in buried servers is growing virulently. it is growing from opportunity, from the shield of the continent’s body. the ocean knows this loss from another kind of parasite, the one none of us mention. her daughter was a small barely conscious species growing in her deepest riffs. these hedopelagic children feasted on the core of the earth until they were all hunted for sport. the wisest died knowing over 20 gesticulations, one of which stood for “joy of being.” </p><br>
                      <p> she searches feverishly, working to protect the continent from further invasion. the continent, with their mutual attrition, treads woozily, most likely from the black blood being harvested from his veins over the last few centuries. i break the silence with a few comments; the rattler-choir would make a good band name, do you guys know a good motown bar around here, i’ve heard this is nice on acid, where would you guys go in the apocalypse, i could use some windshield wipers on my goggles. Ok, guess who i am? i charade a tea pose and balance on the tip of a dune hill, only mildly wobbly. instead of saying trapeze artist, the continent says an airplane after crashing into the hanging gardens. he could never scratch the itch of the hanging gardens. the ocean pipes up, picking up the sound of a drain a kilo or so to the south east. the ocean runs and the footprints rinse away as if touched by lapping water. between the palm-sized riff at our feet, sand cascades fluently. the incision appears to breathe with the wavering grains around the radius. a placard at the door reads: “you will feast and after you will know famine, you will consume and after you will create, you will tire and after you will focus.” the translating continent found the language within and added, “i’m uncertain which synonym of create they are using. this language has approximately fifty.”
                      </p><br>
                      <p> the ocean is a descendant of cliff divers and plunges furst. i follow the continent and splash below. hundreds of meters skinward, the continent is flushed with delerium. silver cooling cabinets line the aisles that the ocean and i walk down. these machines are casting an airy glow only fluorescent enough to read the database files and program names on the hard drives. some of them read; “organic component organizer,” “machine teaching and development,” “attention relapse attention,” “complication of consciousness rehabilitation.” if one of these is a manual, then decryption is the only obstacle to optimization. we could bring everyone we loved back to life with the running of a program. someone figured out why we’re all here, why we cower and crumble, why we plead with gods, why we hurt each other and how we stop. that continental nut was protecting our salvation. the ocean is kicking at the lower shelves with defeat. “you know, your daughter is in here somewhere. her history and her comeback.” she turns to me murderously. “we came here to clean shop.” she says. “there’s no need to destroy it without getting a bigger picture, right?” i’m already shaking. “I’m flooding it.” her waters must be swarming shores and ripping up houses already considering her stare. “we don’t have to change anything, we can just know enough to live comfortably. that’s all i’m asking. run a few programs, then we can fill this place with mud.” i try to hold it in, but my teeth are grinding. the fans are whirring on all the machines suddenly. the lights power down slowly and the racks start lowering into storage.
                      </p><br>
                      <p> of course, they have seismic detection equipment. it’s all safe. “your rain won’t stop this parade,” i snarl at the ocean, stuttering as i do after quakes. the continent was visible a few aisles over as the stacks disappeared. he had a little graphics projector in his fingers that he must have ejected during our fight. given his sullen look, i think he may be deeply pained. he looks over and says, “you know what this was? this was a stream of your episode on the surface world. you’ve finally done it. you separated the ocean and i.” he turns it on. ports and beaches have been replaced by sheer cliffs with raging waters whipping against the wreckage. the mourners all stood far inland and off fault lines. the world would go on in these boundaries, with fear in their hearts. a timer reveals itself in the back of the vacuous library, a countdown of a hundred years until the knowledge is available again. the error note poorly translated reads: quaked with mud.

                      <p> to be rolled over is to stop resisting, and that’s how it starts. then something starts bleeding, but unnoticeably. to stop resisting is a freeing movement, full of jostled bones and distended tendons, a little tear and a micro chunk that actually felt like dead weight. there’s a bounce, a recovery that makes us all smile. nothing scrambled it seems. but no. there are concerning spikes, wild head jerks, un-privy pounces, erratic illness. and then you see a trail of blood where the little love jumped. what looked like a stubbed toe is now something lethally grave. i have to step in as the bystander here and open my mouth, but that is all i will do. agony, your face is silent, but no face like that is silent in the mind of the viewer. jaw and teeth clashing against each other. did your larynx break? not this time. just seen in its final breaths. the skipping and hopping get weaker, blood spills painting crop signals on the concrete. the fractured furry creature rams its neck into a brick rampart and rolls over onto its back, but no there isn’t twitching like in the movies. i tried to imagine it twitching so i could champion rodenta from death a little longer. i couldn’t stop resisting. it would have been a swell time to dry heave. but no. there are replays to go through. all day at work. in slower motion. rolled over.

He takes a choppy call from his teary daughter while downwind from a large building. “remember when you were little in the bathtub,” he begins, “you thought you could blow a water bubble around you to protect you. can you blow like you’re filling up your bubble?” large puffs over the phone and then the line drops. when he gets to the school, she’s still hyperventilating, severely distressed. “come get warm” he says. they pull away and she sniffles out. “how much of me is getting blown away?” “all of you,” he says. the window rolls and she cries. the dog walkers hide from their pets pissing on roadside turbines. “some turbines stop turning, and where one limb may look happy, the other limb gets off balanced. some repairs take many people, plenty of time, and a bit of luck; you never know when the storm will come through to undo everything. you have to find the working turbines in you, not the broken ones.”</p><br><p></p><br><p>two lovers grew still with sail-sagging hearts since one of them knew the end was nearing and the other knew the first believed in this. he said, “i know you don’t feel us breathing no more.” she grievedly emptied her lungs. the floorboard reflections swelled beneath them in the morning gusts. the lights got big some would say. building dresses swept against the brick bodies, while hers sat in flawless folds. “i need you to hear me over that wind in your head baby.” she was on a shallot sand beach elsewhere, with a greyness blurring the horizon. she watched the waters greeness comb over with whitewash tides. she said, “i don’t hear any of it.” he moved his hands from his knees to his hips and rolled his large body deeper into the chair. the windows clattered like a quiet cough or an airy prayer. the distance between them funneled and lifted the grey pencils and the theology books and and the pockets of their clothes and made the lights all bright. he was buzzing in his head from knowing things, feeling the ricochet of little bees off waving petals. “you don’t let me hear you breathing no more. ain’t it different when you let me hear you breathe hun?” and the wind said many things in passing that had to do with the trifles of others. “is this where the wind lands?” she said.</p><br>
