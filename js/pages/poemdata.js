we are students to our design and are learning how to align ourselves in the machinery, among the crowded echos of harbinging, to offer grace when the cat scratches we work through are stinging suddenly, just like our eyes when seeing above the emptiness of a vindictive email, it is there we entreat the hypocrisy stuffed into our dissonant fibers, the dissonance, mind us, of a dragonfly’s speed, we pluck the hypocrisy staggering like stalactites and test its sharpness with a fingertip, let the breaking of our skin be a lesson, let the newness of our flashing lives coagulate in cushion, a construction project that lays down carpet and stimulates further carpentry to balance our feng shei, space is emptiness and emptiness is space, please, i promise to sweep whatever falls and i promise to invite you in even if fresh rocks cover the cave floor, and i promise to make promises i’ll keep or ask for help beyond the promises i can’t promise, i, am enchanted by the study of sense,

				poem: "<p>only a few clicks from a grain farm and with newly installed copper runners, a new flock of wireworms find their way to my woods. at first, during the sprouts of aqua eggs, woodpecking doubled, then chirps multiplied, then squabbling amplified. the noisy talent show of imitation. it wasn't until ice dusting time that quiet resumed, amd their yellow bills mimicked the damp warped wood and formed small twigs from untidy nests.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>then i was devastatingly in company.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the low register of husky “no” trebutcheed from the branches. just once. the beady voids trained on my position. it made my gloves clammy. business slowed, and i found myself leaving only for dry lumber in the shed. one dusk, a shrill violin from a distance, one slightly sharp c and one b sharp. the beak was just above me, but the distance could have been stars or further. a rapid stringing echoing off planets, but repeated within reach.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the next morning, two of them read over and over the first 11 values multiplied by four starting with three. three and twelve sounded like 'please help'. 192 and 768 sounded like 'to send'. i heard 'he ate four' and towards the end, 'tooth'. those numbers bounced back and forth in that same low register with an avian anxiety.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>holed away and staring at eleven numbers, the fire went out a few hours before i noticed. on the walk to the shed, the sound of a bush moving was made. and then the whole flock, thousands, erupted in the sound of a bush moving at startling speeds towards me. the rush of noise was so abundant, it ricocheted off the mountain behind me. i could see now, little bushels of feather, forming a path in the empty canopy line.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>i grabbed my axe and marched down the feathered path as the sun set. as soon as i stepped past the first two nests, a monologue began in unison, and every step passed another checkpoint of bird homes, the monologue continued where it left off, the first starlings still going. the growing intensity aided my memory:</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the buildings of come down.”</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>this was the first time i’d noticed that the ice had foot prints. while seeming human, there was no tread for boots.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p>burn to stay warm.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>you are copying us without learning.</p><br></br><p>you are following us without seeing.”</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the dissonant violin strings started to fade in from the starling throats. what was at first a solo has become a full orchestra.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p>burn to stay warm.</p><br></br><p>pluck to make pillows.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>you are chasing and you are chased.</p><br></br><p>chased by the sounds you chase away from your teeth.”</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>my own steps started to get swallowed by the low voice distorted by screaming strings. at the same time, my sight was swallowed by darkness. the axe splinters cut through the gloves, and a trail of red drops formed in the ice behind me.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p>burn to stay warm.</p><br></br><p>pluck to make pillows.</p><br></br><p>labor to find tomorrow.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>you are a tooth pulled away from the mouth.</p><br></br><p>you are a crown filled with glass.”</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the low pace of speech had carried me further than ever traveled, deeper into a side of the forest i’d never seen. it was here i noticed that the path had closed behind me. a flock had formed at my flank, pulsing with choral words and pushing me deeper. it was here. ears covered, knees wet, and still hearing.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p>burn to stay warm.</p><br></br><p>pluck to make pillows.</p><br></br><p>labor to find tomorrow.</p><br></br><p>step to flatten paths.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>in my mouth you will find your taste.</p><br></br><p>in my words you will find your blood.”</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the snow up ahead didn’t reflect light. the shadows of trees here clotted the light of trees there. the white of snow here fell to the black of snow there. the wet of wood smell here met the wet of blood smell there.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>“tear down to build up.</p><br></br><p>burn to stay warm.</p><br></br><p>pluck to make pillows.</p><br></br><p>labor to find tomorrow.</p><br></br><p>step to flatten paths.</p><br></br><p>hollow to make sound.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>human intestines make a perfect fifth.</p><br></br><p>if you make them swallow the teeth.”</p><br></br>"

				poem: "<p>fossilized verisimilitude drinks like black gold. children of bias and paramnesia, oily factoids are refined and run through digital panoptic pumps. from precision to recall, sensitivity to specificity, the desire machine is a confusion matrix, where the essence of lack is steeped in falsehoods. in order to execute integrity in the post truth society, there needs to be a reconstruction of identity. start with the redirection of adversity, adrenergic and primordial. then come the abbreviated semiotic chains, linguistic aerialism and label generation. possession follows, prescribing selfhood in grievous contrast to the assumptions of reality. then come the superposition optics, the reconciliation of proportionality and experience. by integrating the subjectification of truth with tyrannical institutions, enervated research, and imbued ritualism; the post-truth structuralist will desire all that counters modus operandi.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>there is an operant model for the illusory mind folding that transpires over distrust. there is an anchor for relevance and that is asperity. the prodding of the physical world reinforces not only our mortal fate, it also corrals our intention. in post truth structuralism specifically, it is important to convince the reader that both they, character-leaders, and the author traverse portals where they readily accept the modal reactions against the newly perceived pain. particularly the modality of critical obligation. any provided information is filtered through this lens of relevance, specific and sensitive to the conditions the character-leaders endure.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>as in Orwellian dystopians and Derrida’s discourse, aporia stretches the word. freshly tinkered tools make for incombatative subordinates, completely dislocated from anteriorially confirmed common tongue. the machine is all trustful, whereas the counter-machine is inherently disobedient. distrust paradoxically stems from compliance. this becomes evident in the case of the search engine. the results, summoned in microseconds, come trained from the obfuscated actions of counter-machines. in the ultimate relevance, pain is avoided or intentionally opposed, an intention mirrored in the search engine’s attempts to seduce the searcher. errors ensue when the machine inaccurately or ineffectively draws results nocuous to the reader’s contradictions. reproducing these errors in droves, however, does not illicit distrust. it’s the forgery of this classification system that causes distraction.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>this model then perpetrates the individual, authoritatively demanding the release of any alternate loyalties. in absolutism, there is vigilant innocence, everything excuses. generally, thought patterns are products of large pockets. commandeered thought is achieved by spectacle, catastrophizing, and other cognitive distortions in tangent with institutional degradation. the methods of comparison and confirmation are complicated by resistance to opposition. nothing may be asked of future commutuality.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>in disorder to understand, let us calculate. value is in the search for truth. for example, a beggar is attuned to true and false positives and negatives. the benevolence of a transient bears certain truths and falsehoods. the experience of this recipient sampled is purely positive and cumulative. precision in this case lies in actions, the true grace over the complete positive yield, positive as in experienced; it is signaled to the beggar that there is a fragmented proportion of mercy. countered to this precision is the fraction of recall, ciphered by counting the true positives over the sum of true kindness, which cannot be counted without knowing the value of false negatives or the passerbys that never cross paths. notice now, where are the true negatives? they represent those that never cross paths, however, these are biased predictions. even in the 'weighted harmonic mean of both precision and recall,' the beggar institutes some biases to assume that those not meeting chance would find the beggar unworthy. this is obviously distressful. if one is conciliated to the true value of negatives, then an informedness may be deducted by summing recall, or sensitivity, with its inverse specificity, otherwise known as the now known true negatives over that value and the experienced false positives. this would be the feeling of proportional paltriness compared to all the spit and bile in the beggar’s face. finally, markedness or the phi coefficient is the closest value to assimilate the confusion matrix. is a specified distribution present in outcome frequencies in a sample? do we now know the 'goodness' of fit?</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>the despot would feed you with certaint sensitive information, knowingly false bits and bites fractioned by illusive true negatives. you can know intuitively what you have never seen, all limned in the desire object, an ambiguous and anachronistic reflection of designed lack.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>[1. In a world where integrity seems to be gone, there are 4 steps to take in order to counter the lies built in one's culture. a) identify one's pain and the directions it sends oneself b) notice one's labels around pain and desire c) take note of how one takes possession of certain labels and d) see if one's possessions are proportional and considerable to the experience of others.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>2. Pain is our anchor and attention grabber. \"Shoulds\" or critical obligations, only matter to oneself if relevant to their experience.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>3. Labels allow for irresolvable contradictions to exist in one’s logic. Like looking for something in a search engine, one only knows what’s yielded. The search engine won’t give one the perfect information nor will it give one all the information. It classifies one’s search and pieces together what it’s been trained to reveal. This information could contradict itself, but one knows what one is looking for. One will do the work to couple or decouple this information based on the expectation of the search and the results.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>4.Complete possession of these results creates a kind of loyalty that is instantly excused from any criticism. Large funding of broad-reaching misinformation campaigns can design a propaganda machine that uses cognitive distortions to compare and affirm the misinformation.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>5.A confusion matrix includes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. One cannot calculate them all without bias. The unhoused ask for money, and in this example, the true positives and negatives are whether or not someone gives money when they pass the human asking. False positives and negatives can’t be known, only assumed, since we do not know of how someone will react if they haven’t encountered this person. What becomes normalized in this person’s thinking is generally an assumption that if someone doesn’t pass them, they wouldn’t give anyway, as if they’re avoiding this person (whether from lack of funds or wanting to escape the unhoused).</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>6. The phi coefficient is the relationship between a table of data that shows for accuracy in a confusion matrix. Essentially, if all one finds to be true relies on assumptions of what hasn’t been experienced, then one’s predictive skills are poor and will yield more bias.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>7. If the news seems false and one is basing this prediction on what hasn’t been experienced, then the predictive accuracy gets weaker. An authoritarian will make one practice this until one has redefined pain, adopted new labels, taken possession of certain labels, and compared their experience as true to the assumed falsification of others experiences. Lack is only an enemy when designed that way. The opportunity to be curious and add more to your true yield, no matter how painful, is worth the work.]</p><br></br>"

Destruction attempted to impress Creation by building a machine for ripping the mane off a horse’s neck in a single switch. Dazzled, Creation hungered for egregiously abundant bundles of mane, which Destruction found encouraging. unfortunately, a salacious side in gods demoralized and dismantled the sensibilities of the equine kingdom. against power, they paled and felt thin in their coats. at the battle scene finale, Creation strung a bow from the king’s mane and played Anna Clyne’s prince of clouds on a double necked violin. gravitational math / returning of soul to body ten times watched from the back of a black sheep and asked his eldest sister, Loss, to surgically extract the piercing in his heart and stitch it into spacetime.

Anger fumed into the guilt of Regrettable Mistakes, bringing no-fucks-given into the universe. rumors suggest Negligence may have been the third part in an ignominious threesome. practically orphaned, no-fucks-given spent their formative years chasing Destruction until their unionization. they met at an asteroid fringe knocking orbital weapons into small stars. they were an explosive cluster, but no-fucks-given only drove Destruction to Creation. to break the penchant of theirco-dependence, Destruction warped no-fucks-given into the past. Creation tempered Destruction through remorseful incest and spawned Control. Destruction was penalized when Anger bore witness to his offspring, and was worse yet tormented by Creation’s decisions as to who the godmother of Control would be. No-fucks-given, after being fired into the past, had found and befriended Creation through casual inebriated brunches while Destruction razed the universe with his mistress. Control was raised with her godmother’s intuition and uncovered a perpetual balance between Risk and Expectation, both of which were love crafted to be childhood friends. the genderless child of Time, Addiction, grew up alone until they met Control. they were inseparatable and Control became disoriented. when Loss visited with her children, Control was sundered by withdrawing afflictions. she seized at the family bbq, and Time ripped off a finger worth a trillion years called Healing. the touch of healing sent Control into a torpid slumber, the first comatose.

				poem: "<p>cw.drug_abuse/suicide</p><br></br><p>we were born as cold endings. we leave unfavorable litterings around riverside benches. our response delays to telecommunication are unparalleled. in our code, the repeated hypocrisy of pride and financial requests further prolongs a deafness to the litany of humility. you may find us, soiled in conscience and overly conscious, scarcely staying awake only to squeeze the feeling a little longer. We will look up from the carpet and lie until our teeth are too obviously whispering to each other. the pieces we promise come up as crumbs. the crumbs we promise already vacuumed by our lips. we suck in everything until we suck in ourselves. sometimes in sobriety, we scream for a prayer and annoy bystanders. every now and then the prayer is dialed and the authorities are summoned. we are only helpful in the way that we help officers earn their keep. it’s weeks of leeching before that. i laugh at the blood spilling from my finger because it looks like turtle calvary. i seal it with a hot spoon, a tiny torched alien saucer. it’s all i’ve laughed at for weeks. the turtles are being experimented on, objective repurposing. my body gets pins and needles too, and i feel a new wave of turtles that want out.</p><br></br>"

Co-existence peeked out inimically. the ocean wandered through, parched and ceremonial, riding a camel, both separated from their newborns. the ocean swayed tectonically, and we stood around car bits. put your ear to the muffler, it sounds like me. the continent found paradise in driftwood charred lizard guts, then hallucinated that reality looked like dry bleakness, bleeding from granular scrapes all at the surface. continents are puppies at perma-sit, petulant for attention and puerile with their conversation. the continent often bears lone witness to a howling imagination, ripe with planet collision and the alien abduction of beaches, a certain deskinning if you will. i suggested we pack up, put the crest at the bottom, heaviest first. these desert dunes remind me of subcutaneous insects feeding under atmospheric skin; slightly raised, alive, and immune. a cut down the middle would open the blood creek, drown the sand and skin scorpions until their pincers looked like rotted coral. the ocean looks at me without forgiveness and with scales in her teeth. the continent will meet her gaze, and they will discuss speed bumps in parking garages. they will discuss cumulus chaos, their conspiracies and documentaries. an undertow feels like a long conversation drawn out by unbridled neuron waving. the casualty of listlessness is inside us. the ocean is also inside us, but that wet is making me cold. i am an earthquake, torn between two homes: a shallow shelf and the bottomless well.</p><br></br><p> cacti gesticulate their hellos in comic ways, a greeting that eases me as we leave the fried car behind. wreathed in a rubber tire, one cactus is staring down desert flames. axles are melting into oh shapes and sea shapes. it is a violation to touch anything in this country except bedrock. desperate ascetics dig with reservoir dreams. they are right to do so with the alien library just miles below. our trio are the surgeons operating while the patients operate with us. a delicate language tucked in buried servers is growing virulently. it is growing from opportunity, from the shield of the continent’s body. the ocean knows this loss from another kind of parasite, the one none of us mention. her daughter was a small barely conscious species growing in her deepest riffs. these hedopelagic children feasted on the core of the earth until they were all hunted for sport. the wisest died knowing over 20 gesticulations, one of which stood for “joy of being.” </p><br></br><p> she searches feverishly, working to protect the continent from further invasion. the continent, with their mutual attrition, treads woozily, most likely from the black blood being harvested from his veins over the last few centuries. i break the silence with a few comments; the rattler-choir would make a good band name, do you guys know a good motown bar around here, i’ve heard this is nice on acid, where would you guys go in the apocalypse, i could use some windshield wipers on my goggles. Ok, guess who i am? i charade a tea pose and balance on the tip of a dune hill, only mildly wobbly. instead of saying trapeze artist, the continent says an airplane after crashing into the hanging gardens. he could never scratch the itch of the hanging gardens. the ocean pipes up, picking up the sound of a drain a kilo or so to the south east. the ocean runs and the footprints rinse away as if touched by lapping water. between the palm-sized riff at our feet, sand cascades fluently. the incision appears to breathe with the wavering grains around the radius. a placard at the door reads: “you will feast and after you will know famine, you will consume and after you will create, you will tire and after you will focus.” the translating continent found the language within and added, “i’m uncertain which synonym of create they are using. this language has approximately fifty.”</p><br></br><p> the ocean is a descendant of cliff divers and plunges furst. i follow the continent and splash below. hundreds of meters skinward, the continent is flushed with delerium. silver cooling cabinets line the aisles that the ocean and i walk down. these machines are casting an airy glow only fluorescent enough to read the database files and program names on the hard drives. some of them read; “organic component organizer,” “machine teaching and development,” “attention relapse attention,” “complication of consciousness rehabilitation.” if one of these is a manual, then decryption is the only obstacle to optimization. we could bring everyone we loved back to life with the running of a program. someone figured out why we’re all here, why we cower and crumble, why we plead with gods, why we hurt each other and how we stop. that continental nut was protecting our salvation. the ocean is kicking at the lower shelves with defeat. “you know, your daughter is in here somewhere. her history and her comeback.” she turns to me murderously. “we came here to clean shop.” she says. “there’s no need to destroy it without getting a bigger picture, right?” i’m already shaking. “I’m flooding it.” her waters must be swarming shores and ripping up houses already considering her stare. “we don’t have to change anything, we can just know enough to live comfortably. that’s all i’m asking. run a few programs, then we can fill this place with mud.” i try to hold it in, but my teeth are grinding. the fans are whirring on all the machines suddenly. the lights power down slowly and the racks start lowering into storage.</p><br></br><p> of course, they have seismic detection equipment. it’s all safe. “your rain won’t stop this parade,” i snarl at the ocean, stuttering as i do after quakes. the continent was visible a few aisles over as the stacks disappeared. he had a little graphics projector in his fingers that he must have ejected during our fight. given his sullen look, i think he may be deeply pained. he looks over and says, “you know what this was? this was a stream of your episode on the surface world. you’ve finally done it. you separated the ocean and i.” he turns it on. ports and beaches have been replaced by sheer cliffs with raging waters whipping against the wreckage. the mourners all stood far inland and off fault lines. the world would go on in these boundaries, with fear in their hearts. a timer reveals itself in the back of the vacuous library, a countdown of a hundred years until the knowledge is available again. the error note poorly translated reads: quaked with mud.</p><br></br>"

It was directed by viking film students. They included your paintings in the credits. I hate to spoil the ending, but I leave you. The soundtrack was going to be radiohead, but Yorke’s record label yanked it. So silent film. Silent students acting like they never learn for my benefit. If it isn’t already obvious, the film is me. And you’ll never read this letter, as I’m already loading it into the movie reel and projecting it into snowy pine trees somewhere in Canada that i’ve never been.</p><br></br><p></p><br></br><p>Previous Lover and Grateful Friend,</p><br></br>"
