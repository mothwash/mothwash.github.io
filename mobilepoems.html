                          <p> climbed the whitewash and stomped on it until the tide, death, and bumper stickers jutted from the sand. Co-existence peeked out inimically. the ocean wandered through, parched and ceremonial, riding a camel, both separated from their newborns. the ocean swayed tectonically, and we stood around car bits. put your ear to the muffler, it sounds like me. the continent found paradise in driftwood charred lizard guts, then hallucinated that reality looked like dry bleakness, bleeding from granular scrapes all at the surface. continents are puppies at perma-sit, petulant for attention and puerile with their conversation. the continent often bears lone witness to a howling imagination, ripe with planet collision and the alien abduction of beaches, a certain deskinning if you will. i suggested we pack up, put the crest at the bottom, heaviest first. these desert dunes remind me of subcutaneous insects feeding under atmospheric skin; slightly raised, alive, and immune. a cut down the middle would open the blood creek, drown the sand and skin scorpions until their pincers looked like rotted coral. the ocean looks at me without forgiveness and with scales in her teeth. the continent will meet her gaze, and they will discuss speed bumps in parking garages. they will discuss cumulus chaos, their conspiracies and documentaries. an undertow feels like a long conversation drawn out by unbridled neuron waving. the casualty of listlessness is inside us. the ocean is also inside us, but that wet is making me cold. i am an earthquake, torn between two homes: a shallow shelf and the bottomless well.
      </p><br>
                          <p> cacti gesticulate their hellos in comic ways, a greeting that eases me as we leave the fried car behind. wreathed in a rubber tire, one cactus is staring down desert flames. axles are melting into oh shapes and sea shapes. it is a violation to touch anything in this country except bedrock. desperate ascetics dig with reservoir dreams. they are right to do so with the alien library just miles below. our trio are the surgeons operating while the patients operate with us. a delicate language tucked in buried servers is growing virulently. it is growing from opportunity, from the shield of the continent’s body. the ocean knows this loss from another kind of parasite, the one none of us mention. her daughter was a small barely conscious species growing in her deepest riffs. these hedopelagic children feasted on the core of the earth until they were all hunted for sport. the wisest died knowing over 20 gesticulations, one of which stood for “joy of being.” </p><br>
                          <p> she searches feverishly, working to protect the continent from further invasion. the continent, with their mutual attrition, treads woozily, most likely from the black blood being harvested from his veins over the last few centuries. i break the silence with a few comments; the rattler-choir would make a good band name, do you guys know a good motown bar around here, i’ve heard this is nice on acid, where would you guys go in the apocalypse, i could use some windshield wipers on my goggles. Ok, guess who i am? i charade a tea pose and balance on the tip of a dune hill, only mildly wobbly. instead of saying trapeze artist, the continent says an airplane after crashing into the hanging gardens. he could never scratch the itch of the hanging gardens. the ocean pipes up, picking up the sound of a drain a kilo or so to the south east. the ocean runs and the footprints rinse away as if touched by lapping water. between the palm-sized riff at our feet, sand cascades fluently. the incision appears to breathe with the wavering grains around the radius. a placard at the door reads: “you will feast and after you will know famine, you will consume and after you will create, you will tire and after you will focus.” the translating continent found the language within and added, “i’m uncertain which synonym of create they are using. this language has approximately fifty.”
                          </p><br>
                          <p> the ocean is a descendant of cliff divers and plunges furst. i follow the continent and splash below. hundreds of meters skinward, the continent is flushed with delerium. silver cooling cabinets line the aisles that the ocean and i walk down. these machines are casting an airy glow only fluorescent enough to read the database files and program names on the hard drives. some of them read; “organic component organizer,” “machine teaching and development,” “attention relapse attention,” “complication of consciousness rehabilitation.” if one of these is a manual, then decryption is the only obstacle to optimization. we could bring everyone we loved back to life with the running of a program. someone figured out why we’re all here, why we cower and crumble, why we plead with gods, why we hurt each other and how we stop. that continental nut was protecting our salvation. the ocean is kicking at the lower shelves with defeat. “you know, your daughter is in here somewhere. her history and her comeback.” she turns to me murderously. “we came here to clean shop.” she says. “there’s no need to destroy it without getting a bigger picture, right?” i’m already shaking. “I’m flooding it.” her waters must be swarming shores and ripping up houses already considering her stare. “we don’t have to change anything, we can just know enough to live comfortably. that’s all i’m asking. run a few programs, then we can fill this place with mud.” i try to hold it in, but my teeth are grinding. the fans are whirring on all the machines suddenly. the lights power down slowly and the racks start lowering into storage.
                          </p><br>
                          <p> of course, they have seismic detection equipment. it’s all safe. “your rain won’t stop this parade,” i snarl at the ocean, stuttering as i do after quakes. the continent was visible a few aisles over as the stacks disappeared. he had a little graphics projector in his fingers that he must have ejected during our fight. given his sullen look, i think he may be deeply pained. he looks over and says, “you know what this was? this was a stream of your episode on the surface world. you’ve finally done it. you separated the ocean and i.” he turns it on. ports and beaches have been replaced by sheer cliffs with raging waters whipping against the wreckage. the mourners all stood far inland and off fault lines. the world would go on in these boundaries, with fear in their hearts. a timer reveals itself in the back of the vacuous library, a countdown of a hundred years until the knowledge is available again. the error note poorly translated reads: quaked with mud.

The loaded strangers, they can’t stop regarding, in a sea of judgement that’s cracking underneath. never thought i’d make a mess here. at the worst i’d gather dust. there’s no way i end the cold war, but i’ll rag myself and feel the lightness of a damp towel made dry. i know a city bar that uses lanterns to keep the moths out the door. the girl sells drinks - says she’s alive. she hands out bottles through the back, ‘cause there’s too much around, and just enough for the drainage we neglect. never thought i’d make a mess here. at the worst they’d call the cops. they told me, go and study business. now the market takes the kids while i couldn’t sell myself to make the grade. to fall asleep i need the tempo, of a slower speed than shame, of a slower kind of process, that makes the moment a teacher i can follow. never thought i’d make a mess here. at the worst i’d stare for hours. we get fired, forget intention. coma dollars come out clean.

He takes a choppy call from his teary daughter while downwind from a large building. “remember when you were little in the bathtub,” he begins, “you thought you could blow a water bubble around you to protect you. can you blow like you’re filling up your bubble?” large puffs over the phone and then the line drops. when he gets to the school, she’s still hyperventilating, severely distressed. “come get warm” he says. they pull away and she sniffles out. “how much of me is getting blown away?” “all of you,” he says. the window rolls and she cries. the dog walkers hide from their pets pissing on roadside turbines. “some turbines stop turning, and where one limb may look happy, the other limb gets off balanced. some repairs take many people, plenty of time, and a bit of luck; you never know when the storm will come through to undo everything. you have to find the working turbines in you, not the broken ones.”</p><br><p></p><br><p>two lovers grew still with sail-sagging hearts since one of them knew the end was nearing and the other knew the first believed in this. he said, “i know you don’t feel us breathing no more.” she grievedly emptied her lungs. the floorboard reflections swelled beneath them in the morning gusts. the lights got big some would say. building dresses swept against the brick bodies, while hers sat in flawless folds. “i need you to hear me over that wind in your head baby.” she was on a shallot sand beach elsewhere, with a greyness blurring the horizon. she watched the waters greeness comb over with whitewash tides. she said, “i don’t hear any of it.” he moved his hands from his knees to his hips and rolled his large body deeper into the chair. the windows clattered like a quiet cough or an airy prayer. the distance between them funneled and lifted the grey pencils and the theology books and and the pockets of their clothes and made the lights all bright. he was buzzing in his head from knowing things, feeling the ricochet of little bees off waving petals. “you don’t let me hear you breathing no more. ain’t it different when you let me hear you breathe hun?” and the wind said many things in passing that had to do with the trifles of others. “is this where the wind lands?” she said.</p><br>
