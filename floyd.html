My heart desperately wishes well for the families of lost or locked up loved ones due to police brutality or injustice. The intent here is to impassion white people to act, speak, create, invest, and demonstrate since we have indestructible bodies. That must be tested in order to define a New Normal of equality. In loving memory of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Michael Brown, Isiah Marietta-Golding, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery. If you haven’t yet, consider donating to BLM, ACLU, or your local bail fund.</i></h4>

                <h3>Three humpback whales come across a pair of killer whales harassing a single seal. The first humpback lost their calf to a killer whale and charged in. The second humpback now has a litany of reasons to charge in. Perhaps the second humpback was moved by the first. Or maybe the second humpback had similar trauma, with positive or negative outcomes reinforcing their decision to charge against the killer whales. The second humpback saw that another humpback whale in the moment would make an impact. It more than leveled the playing field. The third humpback says, “oh they’ll be fine without me.”</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Is there room for the third humpback when correcting the racism and inequality in America? The humpback is essentially justifying the question, “should I do something?” It is a leap from abstraction to absolution. There are infinite things you should do. It is in your programming to develop, to find security, and to understand; all of these require constant movement in today’s world. Instead of counting to infinity each morning (and seriously depressing ourselves with guilt), we use the principle of induction to confirm our reality. If something happens, we induct it into our mental hall of fame and remember the important consequences. This is how we “normalize.” A symptom accelerating with our growing intolerance for uncertainty.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>We suffer from a constant feed of radicalizing influence. We suffer from an anger that we hope will control our fear and sadness. We starve on this mixed diet of baseless content and senseless violence. We do not come into this world, we come out of it. We are looking at all of time, only one piece at a time, and counting just it’s eras, events, and epilogues. We need the whole picture, back to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html">1619</a>.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>People of Color are suffering from predation from the police. Marginalized populations are suffering from extreme disparities in wealth, education, and health. The police have a culture of protectionism and entitlement buried in their ranks. They are trained with instinct that is killer, not peace keeping.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Behind masked faces and social accounts, riot gear and tinted windows, there are shadow selves growing darker. The person behind the persona repulsed. The shadow self is all that one finds disgusting in oneself projected on another. Our carnal understandings of reactivity are no longer flexible enough to contextualize these projections as they happen. We need a more practical model.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Let’s return to the humpback story. A team of bystanders makes it a bit easy to intervene for the sake of justice. Let’s assume now it’s just the third humpback confronting two killer whales. The situation is much more adverse. In this instance, a white person would most likely walk away from two cops harassing a black man. </h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Altruism is generally what we use to characterize the humane affect from the machine affect. Compassion and benevolence. Yet altruism and its absence exist in both extremes among us. We are discovering how cold and calculating and binary we can be. Our minds are firing neurons, little switches on and off, and the sum of all switches paints the picture.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>These drapes around us are designed, or in other words, the racism is systemic. We assume justice will set its course or karma will intervene or more comically that the individual will prevail. There are excuses built into our ego driven language that prevent us from acting, such as, “oh they’ll be fine without me.”</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>They won’t. The humpback whale learns its altruism from social cues, experience, and training. That’s how it becomes animal instinct. It needs to happen collectively. The way a team of firefighters can plunge into a burning building together.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>We have such stratified ways of life in this country. We live with the killer whales. The police lurk our streets in armored vehicles. We also live with humpbacks like the third. Where does their doubt come from? Why do they doubt their own impact? The source is their fervent commitment to the things they value without seeing the relationship of their faith to another’s faith. Primarily a faith in the fact that yes, we will run into that building together. In order to accept the new normal model, they need a faith in exploration rather than reference. Their current point of reference is the privilege that has kept them safe.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>There are new methods of resistance to explore. These means include acting, speaking, creating/writing, investing (organizing and donating), and demonstrating against every iota of intolerance. A whale doesn’t die instantly. It’s functions slowly deteriorate, until the head falls forward and life no longer breathes.</h3>
                <br></br>
                <h3>We all share the same picture of time. Right now, that is a picture of new hungriness in our streets, that is a picture of new tears shed from projected noxious fears, that is a picture of new breathlessness caused by sicknesses in police culture, that is a picture of new words passed from once quiet lips. That picture is burning. It’s time for us all to run in together. It’s time to abolish the policing occupation in its entirety until it can be rebuilt.</h3>
